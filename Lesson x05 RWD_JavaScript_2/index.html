        <h1>Exercise. JavaScript Functions, Loops, and Timing</h1>
        <p>Experiment with the aritmetic operators, loops and timing in JavaScript.<p>

        <ul>
            <li>Example implemention of a JavaScript fuction that can add two numbers and writes the result out here:</li>
            <li>Implement a fuction that can multiply three numbers, and write the result out here:</li>
            <li>Implement a fuction that can calculate the area of a circle - as argument it should take the radius of the circle, and write the result out here:</li>
            <li>Create an array with five different values (red, blue, green, black and white) and create a function which randomly picks one of the values and display it here:</li>
            <li>Implement a function that can show the current date and tell you the number of full days since 1/1-2015:</li>
            <li>Given the previous implementation, make a note that marks whether the number of full days since 1/1-2015 is even or odd:</li>
            <li>Write a function which can repeatedly incremenet a value with a certain time interval between each incrementation. The time interval and the value to increment with should be arguments to the function.</li>
            <li>Used the previously created function to display two values, where one increment with 1 every second, while the other increment with 2 every other second. All incrementation should stop after 10 seconds:
                <ul>
                    <li id="counter1Id">Counter 1: </li>
                    <li id="counter2Id">Counter 2: </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
